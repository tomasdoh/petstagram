Petstagram [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomasdoh/petstagram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomasdoh/petstagram)
===================



Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).


## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```
